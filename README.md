# Python Conditions

Python Conditions Are Used To Make Any Action At Any Condition.

## How To Use

"if", "elif", "else" are Used In Python Conditions. 
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword. The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition". The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions. Source - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp

```bash
if (something > somethinglesser):
    print("Something is Greater Than Something Lesser")
elif (something = somethinglesser):
    print("Something is Equal to Something Lesser")
else (something < somethinglesser):
    print("Something is Lesser Than Something Lesser")
```
